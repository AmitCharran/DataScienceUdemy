R-squared

    Smaller regression error. Better the regression.

    R-Squared measures the goodness of fit
    R-Squared = SSR (Sum of squared regression) / SST (Sum of squared total)

    R-Squared = (0 - 1)
    1 is a perfect R-squared - hardly ever happens. It explains the entire variability of the data.
    0 means regression line explains none of the variability of the data.







Multiple Linear Regression
    Need multiple regression to consider more factors in a problem
    yhat = b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk (this equation considers more factors)

    more variables usually equal a better fitting model





Adjusted R-squared
    Has multiple regressions (Always smaller than R-squared)
    Adjusted R-Squared is the basis for comparing models


Significance of F-statistic
    Tests overall significance of the model
    If F-statistic is lower the model is less significant. If higher, more significant


Regressions
    Linear- assumes linearity
        can transform linear in cuvred line
    No endogeneity
        Refers to length between independent variables and errors (refers to ommitted variable bias)
        ommitted variable bias is reflected in the error term
    Normality and homoscedasticity
        Normaility
            has central limit theorem to contain normality
        Homoscedasticity
            means to have equal variance
                Example rich people have higher variability of spending but poor people do not
        Transforms
            using log
    No autocorrelation
        aka no serial correlation
            errors are assumed to be uncorrelated
        Durban-watson test
            0-4
            2= no autocorrelation
            1>= or <=3 autocorrelation (need to rework data or factors)
    No multicollinearity
        When 2 or more variables have a high correlation
            fixes
                drop one or two variables
                transform variables into one variable
                keep both, but adjust things

        Do not form regression that violates one of these assumptions
