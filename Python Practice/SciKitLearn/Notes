Standardization
    The process of subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation

Normalization
    has different meaning depending on the case; here - we subtract the mean but divide by the L2-norm of the inputs

feature_selection.f_regression
    F-regression creates eimple linear regressions of each feature and the dependent variable
       F-regression should be used with caution b/c it's too simplistic

       p-values are the best way to determine if a factor(variable) is redundant
            However it does not provide any information on how useful that variable is


Feature Scaling / Normalization
    Process of transforming data into a standard scale
        Do this by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation

Underfitting vs Overfitting
    Overfitting = our regression has focused on the particular training ser so much, it has missed the point
        hard to spot b/c everything is right
            split data in to 2 type. Unsupervised and supervised
    Underfitting = The model has not captured the logic yet
        easy to spot b/c no accuracy
